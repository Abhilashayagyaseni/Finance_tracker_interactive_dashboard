# finance_tracker_interactive_dashboard

This project is about tracking income and expenses. 
To create good visualization I used some awesome excel features.

- Here some charts and graphs are used such as
  - Bar chart
  - column chart
  - pie chart
  - line chart
- Some stickers are used to easly understand the numbers
- slicers are used to make it interactive.
- In-Cell Bar Chart With Conditional Formatting for comapring values
